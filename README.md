## âœ¨âœ¨ Hey You! âœ¨âœ¨
I am a pythonista. I code mostly in Python with Django and other frameworks.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the MYHEALTHCOP apps to bring wellness to everyone in Ghana. Also

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning advanced AI tech and will soon be heavily concentrating on AI applications, especially in the EdTech and HealthTech industry but I am open to other fields too 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d like to collaborate on opensource community projects that are not just fancy doables but actually useful to the world. If you have one such project I am happy to contribute
